# CardyBee
We believe that flashcards are an amazing tool to improve study flows and efficacy. We lean on various studies proving that distributed practice and practice testing are highly effective when it comes to understanding and learning new concepts, and flashcards are an awesome tool to implement these two strategies. The aim of our project is to support both teachers with their work and students with their studies. In particular, we have been working on a native AI service that not only helps students by skipping the overwhelming task of crafting the flashcards decks, but also provides teachers with the power to create sharable decks and flashcards live, directly while explaining the lecture. We believe that this approach could be beneficial for both parties, and could be a first step in the promotion of flashcards as a go-to teaching and learning tool.
