# CardyBee
We believe that flashcards are an amazing tool to improve study flows and efficacy. We lean on various studies proving that distributed practice and practice testing are highly effective when it comes to understanding and learning new concepts, and flashcards are an awesome tool to implement these two strategies. The aim of our project is to support both teachers with their work and students with their studies. In particular, we have been working on a native AI service that not only helps students by skipping the overwhelming task of crafting the flashcards decks, but also provides teachers with the power to create sharable decks and flashcards live, directly while explaining the lecture. We believe that this approach could be beneficial for both parties, and could be a first step in the promotion of flashcards as a go-to teaching and learning tool.

## User Guide
* Navigate to [CardyBee](https://cardybee.vercel.app/)
* From the Home Page click on the login button.
* Use the provided credentials to log in:
  * username: test@test.com
  * password: test
* After logging in, you will automatically return to the Home Page.
* Access the "My Decks" page from the button on the top right to explore existing decks.
* Delete any of the existing decks according to your preferences.
* To create a new deck, return to the homepage and either:

```
The gameplay of Oracle of Seasons and Ages is similar to that of Link's Awakening (1993) for Game Boy, copying basic controls, graphics, and sounds.[7][8] Like most Legend of Zelda games, exploration and combat take place from an overhead perspective. Link uses a sword for his primary attack, complemented by secondary weapons and items. Basic items such as bombs and a boomerang are common to both games. Other items are exclusive to one game, with a counterpart in the other (e.g., the slingshot in Seasons and the seed shooter in Ages both shoot seeds, while the magnetic gloves in Seasons and the switch hook in Ages are used to access otherwise unreachable areas). Unlike most Zelda games, a sword and shield is not always equipped when the player possesses them; they can be assigned like any other item into either of two available slots.
```
* Once the deck is generated, you can browse the cards by using the keyboard or clicking on the on-screen arrows. Clicking on a card or pressing return flips the card, pressing spacebar expands the card if it cannot fit the text.
* To test the live mode, return to the home page and click on “record”. Press on “listening paused” to activate the recording and talk about a topic you’re interested in for at least 1 minute to see cards appear.
* You can switch between light and dark mode based on your preferences by pressing on the sun or moon icon on the top right.
